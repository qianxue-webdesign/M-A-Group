DESIGN BRIEF:
Start brainstorming ideas in response to the design brief:
What are your ideas and goals for the project?
	We want to inform the public about climate change and encourage them to perform activities that help reduce the effects of climate change.
The brief is broad, start by thinking of the specific problem area you want to focus.
Climate change - bushfires
Take a look at what has already been done - websites, strategies, etc.
Apps: https://www.climatechangenews.com/2013/09/24/top-10-climate-change-apps/
How does your idea build on/differ from what has been done before?
We notice that it is important to make people realize connections between their lives and climate change. People should be able to interact with our product in different ways and not just glance through some boring readings.
How will you achieve the idea? Rough ideas or sketches of your potential solution? Think big and refine later!
